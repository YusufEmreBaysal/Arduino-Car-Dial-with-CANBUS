# Arduino-Car-Dial-with-CANBUS
This project demonstrates the operation of a Controller Area Network (CAN) system using Arduino microcontrollers. The system comprises three sets, each including one Arduino Microcontroller, one CANBUS-SPI Module, and the necessary sensors and modules.

The first system set is designed to showcase the car's throttle system, the second set focuses on demonstrating the motor RPM sensor, and the third set aims to illustrate the car motor controller while displaying speed and RPM on a car's dial.
