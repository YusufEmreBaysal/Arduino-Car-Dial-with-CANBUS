# Arduino-Car-Dial-with-CANBUS
In this project, operation of Controller Area Network System is demonstraded by using Arduino microcontrollers. There are 3 Arduino-Canbus Module system sets in the system, each set consists of 1 Arduino Microcontroller, 1 CANBUS-SPI Module and necessary sensors and/or modules.

The first system set is designed to showcase the car's throttle system, the second set focuses on demonstrating the motor RPM sensor, and the third set aims to illustrate the car motor controller while displaying speed and RPM on a car's dial.
